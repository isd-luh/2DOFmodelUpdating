# 2DOFmodelUpdating
2DOF model updating problem considering uncertainty including implementations of TMCMC, MCGO and meta-MCGO 

This code contains the setup of the 2DOF model updating problem by Lye et al. (2021, doi: 10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107760)
in addition to the implementation of the TMCMC, MCGO and meta-MCGO algorithms introduced by Wolniak et al. (2023, doi:?). 
Plot functions used to generate the figures shown in Section 4.3 of the article are also uploaded. 
The code is implemented using the Matlab programming syntax. 

To employ the MCGO and meta-MCGO algorithms with other optimization algorithms than the presented Global Pattern Search, 
additional access to the EngiO framework introduced by Berger et al. (2021, doi:10.1016/j.advengsoft.2020.102959) is needed. 
The framework is also publicly accessible.
